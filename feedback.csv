"Dear Customer,

Greetings from TransUnion CIBIL !

We wish to inform you that a recent loan/credit card enquiry was made on your CIBIL Score and Report with us.

The details of the enquiry are mentioned below:

Bank Name : SBI CARD
Enquiry Control Number (ECN): 10054178119
Enquiry Purpose : CREDIT CARD
Date of Enquiry : 2025-12-12 16:19:04
In case of any queries or clarification regarding the above information, please contact the respective bank/financial institution or connect with us. Please quote your ECN number(s) while communicating with us to help us assist you better.

Visit us for more details
A credit enquiry occurs when a bank/financial institution checks your CIBIL report, usually in connection with a loan or credit application. While checking your CIBIL report, it is important to verify your personal information.

There are certain types of loans (such as small ticket Personal Loans) which are availed through digital lending platforms. These are often financed by partner banks or financial institutions, whose names may appear on your CIBIL Report instead of the platform. Key scenarios include:

Regulated entities offering credit under a different brand name. For e.g., legal entity name displayed on CIBIL report instead of popular application name
Regulated entities offering credit through multiple brands and channels
Loans taken through a digital lending platform may appear multiple times on your CIBIL report, where the loan amount is split between different banks or financial institutions. To better understand this co-lending arrangement, it is essential to carefully review the terms and conditions provided by the digital lending platform
Note: Dispute Resolution is offered for FREE by CIBIL. Consumers are not required to pay any fee for rectifying discrepancies or updating their credit information. Visit us for more details.
